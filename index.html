<h3 id="about">About Christina</h3>

<p>Hi there! I'm Christina Entcheva, an NYC-based professional with experience
  working at tech startups, advertising agencies, and the leading sports and
  entertainment agency.<br/><br/>

  For years I've wanted to switch to software engineering.
  I've finally made the jump, quit my full-time Product Management job, and
  committed myself to learning to code full-time.<br/><br/>

  Before moving into Product Management, I was a Design Director, working to
  assure the products we put out in the world were easy to use, intuitive, and beautiful.<br/><br/>

  I'm also an artist. My animated gif artwork was recently acquired for
  the permanent collection at the Whitney Museum of American Art.<br/><br/>

  In my free time I'm learning to play the guitar and keyboards, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with friends, and enjoy
  reading non-fiction, sci-fi, and classics.<br/><br/>

  I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and currently live in Jersey City, NJ.<br/><br/>

  Say hello!</p></div>
